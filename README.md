# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. The model utilizes historical customer data, including features such as usage behavior and customer demographics, to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the service. The project employs various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, to achieve accurate predictions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/StillTrying44/customer-churn-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main application script:

   ```
   Deploy.py
   ```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Pickle
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can input customer data, including credit score, age, balance, and other relevant features, to predict whether a customer is likely to churn. The application provides real-time predictions and visualizations to help users understand the model's output.
